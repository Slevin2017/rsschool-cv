## INFO
I wanna be a React developer, I'm a stubborn, diligent personality, I study when interesting. 
Allmost more than 8 year i had been waysting my time on CPA and PPC networks jobs and learning some little thinks, like Hugo, Liquid, WP, html banner with GWD, emails markup with Zurb, HTML, CSS, jQ, SASS/SCSS, Git, Gulp. I have declative thinking and it's a big problem for me. 
I have no family and do what i gotta do and it make me ugly, because it's no FE tasks.
